# Film Face Off

## Description

- This project was created to provide users with a way to discover new movies related to movies they already enjoy.
- Provides the user with 8 similar movies and allows them to vote on which movie they would prefer.
- The winning movie is saved to local storage, the title and trailer are displayed on the final page.
- Working on this project was something of a rush. At first it did not seem like it would be all that challenging, but as it grew in size and complexity and the skills needed to develop it increased in number we quickly saw how a project of this nature could become difficult to create. Over the course of the project we not only became very familiar with APIs, but also with Foundation, and collaborating through GitHub. While the final product needs some work yet, we are very happy with the progress we've made and the things we've learned along the way. All four of us are very excited to continue development over the coming weeks.

The user will be prompted with two movie titles, descriptions, and posters. They may pick whichever movie seems more appealing, which sends it to the next of the bracket. 


When the user has chosen a winner for each matchup a winner is chosen. The winner is then displayed on the final page.
